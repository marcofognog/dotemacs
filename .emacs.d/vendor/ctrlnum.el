;;; Commentary:

;; Conveniently switch between file buffers just like you would with
;; Google Chrome's tabs default key bindings:
;;
;; C-1 switches to the first file buffer
;; C-2 switches to the second file buffer
;; ...
;; C-0 switches to the 10th file buffer
;;
;; C-<prior> switch to the previous buffer
;; C-<next> switch to the next buffer
;;
;; C-S-<prior> in buffer causes that buffer to switch place with the previous buffer
;; C-S-<next> the same as the above, but in the other direction
;;
;; Because the native Emacs buffer-list is kept intact, you can still use all
;; the other buffer switching tactics you already have.

;; Full documentation is available as an Info manual.
